Postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics and member of the AI Health Innovation Cluster postdoctoral program. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. at the Cancer Research Center CIC-IBMCC in Salamanca, Spain. My research interests include single-cell analysis and methods, genomics in neurodegenerative diseases and aging, developing novel statistical and bioinformatic methods, and applying different Artificial Intelligence models to molecular and clinical data.
I strongly believe that interdisciplinary research is essential to overcoming new scientific challenges.
